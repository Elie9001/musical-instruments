Elie's Snappy Drum Machine

Version 1.1
-----

Snappy is a drum synth with an 808-like sound but more crisp and ready to cut through any mix.
This version uses JACK audio and ALSA midi.


LIVE MODE
Simple way to get started:

 Run Snappy in a terminal, and play the drums live by typing letters & numbers. Most are Tone Drums (kicks, toms, and congas). You get the higher notes using Shift or Caps Lock. Special keys: '1' is a clap. '~' is a high-hat. '-' is a cowbell.


MIDI INPUT
You can make a lot more sounds this way.

 Arrangement:
 Starting from highest MIDI notes to lowest:

  Short hat  \
  Long hat    \  repeating
  Long clap   /  pattern
  Short clap /
   ...
  Tone drums - congas
   ...
  Tone drums - toms
   ...
  Tone drums - kicks
   ...
  Deep kick with no tuning

To make an 808-style snare: Layer a tom with a short clap (half velocity or less)

To make a wavy "ghost drum" effect, play two tone-drums at exactly the same time.

Tone drums are monophonic. If you want to add some congas that don't cut your kicks & toms, then send the conga notes to Midi Channel 16. This special channel lets you add an extra "auxillary tone". Channel 16 also has cowbells and cymbals (highest notes).


Midi Controllers
- Pitch Wheel: Range: -1 octave to +1 octave. If the tone gets too low, the sound will mute for that moment. This can be used intentionally for strobe effects.
- Sound Variation: This controls the "thickness" of tone drums. Higher is more like a 909, lower is more like an 808.
- Sound Release: Tone drums release time.
- Sound Control 6: Clap release time.
- Sound Control 7: High-hats release time.
- All Controllers Off: Reset to default settings.
- All Notes Off / All Sounds Off: Quick silence.

Channel 16
- Sound Timbre: Auxillary tones decay time.
- Sound Release: Auxillary tones release time.
- Sound Control 6: Cowbell release time.
- Sound Control 7: Cymbals release time.


MORE THINGS TO KNOW

Sample rate will affect the transition point between congas and claps/hats. A lower sample rate = "running out of congas" at a lower point. But above that point, the claps & hats will ALWAYS be arranged the same way, no matter the sample rate.

Use the same sample rate that you plan to use for your final mix. There is no need for supersampling/antialiasing. All drum waveforms are aligned with integer numbers of samples. That's what makes it sound crisp and snappy.

Other programs that work well with Snappy:
- ZynAddSubFX (a synth made by Nasca Paul)
- Snokoder (a vocoder made by me)
- Seq24 (a midi sequencer)
- Rosegarden (another midi sequencer)
- QSynth / FluidSynth
- JACK Rack

If you get bored of the sound of plain snappy drums, try hooking it up to a plate reverb, or a peaking filter (such as Steve Harris's LADSPA called Single Band Parametric).

If someone wants to port Snappy to LADSPA or VSTi, that would be great :D
